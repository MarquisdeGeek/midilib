Version 1.5

Packaged the code for release, not my internal working version. (That didn't 
work!)



Version 1.4

Folded back utilities from SGX. Namely, muGetChordName, muGuessChord.

Updated contact information.



Version 1.3

Library changes: The channel parser was fixed for implied messages. Note on 
messages are automatically translated to note off when volume is 0. 

Armstrong (http://www.bluedust.dontexist.com/armstrong) is supported for the 
Arduino in m2rtttl. 

Rest support was added in m2rtttl.
